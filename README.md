CitizenFX Server (FiveM/RedM) supervisor with Git, log saving, precommands support

I made this for my own purposes, it has been targetted for Windows but nothing restricts it from working on Linux.

This won't work out the box, you'll certainly need to make a resource that pings it so it doesn't think your server has crashed.

Rename config.js.example to config.js and change to your needs.
